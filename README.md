SUP - Simply Use Parse
===
I developed this application as an exercise to learn more about [Parse](http://parse.com) by implementing the basic functionality behind the popular [Yo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justyo).

With this application you can do the following:

1. Create an account
2. Sign into your account
3. Add a friend(s)
4. Send push notification to your friend(s)
